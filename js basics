# JS Def
js is scripting language that is used to build dynamic websites or for dynamic programming
we can divide are code into diff files and we can combine them by importing them into parent file according to need called modularity 

# VARIABLES
* VAR has global and functional scope  can be redecleare and overwrite.  VAR KEYWORDS ARE defi e wit undefine value in memroy called hoisting

* LET has functional scope can't be redecleare but overwrite.  temporar dead zone means if access it before initiallization then we will get referance error 

* CONST has functional scope can't be overwrite and redecleare. 

premitive non premitive
primitive pre defined 7
non premitive obj array

# DATATYPES
* we have 7 datatypes and 1 additional object total 8
* Number,String,BigInt,Boolean,Symbol,Object,undefine,null
* object has keys and values

# string METHODS
LET STR="SAHIL"
* STR[2] WILL GIVE THE CHAR AT 2 INDEX

* CharAt[2] 
 1. will give the char at index 2
 2. The index starts at 0 for the first character in the string. 
    Negative indices are not supported
3.  Returns the character at the specified index as a new string. 
    If the index is out of range (less than 0 or greater than or equal to the string's length), an empty string "" is returned.
4.  returns new string

* str.Substring(2,5) 
1. substring returns new string.
2. Accepts two arguments, the start index and the end index. 
   If the start index is greater than the end index, substring swaps the two arguments.
3. Treats negative arguments as if they were 0.
4. Returns the extracted substring

* str.slice(2,6)  
1. slice: Also accepts two arguments, the start index and the end index. 
   If the start index is greater than the end index, slice returns an empty string or array.
2. Allows negative arguments, which are treated as length + negativeIndex. 
   Negative indices count from the end of the string or array.
3. Returns new array.
4. Neither substring nor slice modify the original string or array.

* str.indexOF()
1. Used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value (substring or character) within a string.
2. string.indexOf(searchValue, startIndex), where string is the string to search within, searchValue is the value to search for,
   and startIndex is an optional parameter specifying the index at which to start the search (default is 0).
3. Returns the index of the first occurrence of searchValue within string, or -1 if searchValue is not found.
4. Commonly used to check if a string contains a specific substring or to find the position of a character within a string.
                  
                   let str = "Hello, World!";
                   console.log(str.indexOf("o")); // 4 (index of the first 'o' in the string)
                   console.log(str.indexOf("l", 3)); // 3 (index of the first 'l' starting from index 3)
                   console.log(str.indexOf("x")); // -1 (search value not found)

5. There are other methods similar to indexOf, 
such as lastIndexOf, which returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified value, 
and includes, which returns true if the string contains a specified value.

* difference
indexOf:
1. The indexOf method returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value (substring or character) within a string.
2. If the value is not found, it returns -1.
3. You can also specify a starting index from which the search should begin.

lastIndexOf:
1. The lastIndexOf method returns the index of the last occurrence of a specified value (substring or character) within a string.
2. If the value is not found, it returns -1.
3. Like indexOf, you can specify a starting index, but the search for the last occurrence begins from the end of the string.

* str.split(" ")
1. This method is used to split  a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator ex:- space,symbol,char etc
2. returns array of strings and original string remains unchanged
3.     string.split(separator, limit);
4.     separator can be anything  and limit is defined if we want array of string till some substrings ex:- 
       
       ex:-       let str = "apple,banana,orange,grape,mango";
                  let fruits = str.split(",", 3);
                  console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

       ex:-     let words = str.split(",", 1);
                console.log(words); // ["apple"]

      ex:-      let allFruits = str.split(",");
                console.log(allFruits); // ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "mango"]


* str.join(" ") 
1. The join() method in JavaScript is used to join all elements of an array into a single string.
2. It takes an optional parameter, separator, which specifies how to separate the elements in the resulting string.
3. If no separator is provided, the elements are joined with a comma by default.

* ToUpperCase()
let st="  HeLlo guys guys";
console.log(st.toUpperCase());

* ToLowerCase()
console.log(st.toLowerCase());

* trim()
console.log(st.trim()); // remvoes the space from start to end 
console.log(st.trimStart()) // removes the space from start
console.log(st.trimEnd()) // removes the space ffrom end 
console.log(st.replace("guys","dosto")) // replaces the first word with last word and if we have multiple same substrings then it will replace with the first one
